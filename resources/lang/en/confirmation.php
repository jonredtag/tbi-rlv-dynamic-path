            <p>With the ongoing changes in travel due to COVID-19, and the rapidness at which things are changing around us, we are continually adapting to serve the needs of our customers. Some countries only permit fully vaccinated travellers, while others require additional screening/testing upon arrival and/or prior to exiting their country. Additionally, the rules for returning home to Canada or the USA from international travel are also changing and can vary based on what destinations you have visited abroad. </p><br />
            <p>Another benefit of using the Sherpa tool is the ease of applying for an eVisa. Sherpa has partnered with many countries around the world to allow travellers the ability to apply and obtain an electronic Visa where required. <a href="'.str_replace(':locale:', App::getLocale(), config('site.travel_requirements')).'" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click here</a> for details</p>',
